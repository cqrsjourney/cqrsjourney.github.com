You are a developer building web apps for internal use at a large corporation. You are tasked with building a line-of-business application that will allow sales people in the field to monitor the stock levels in the various distribution centers in real-time. In addition, employees at the distribution centers will be walking the warehouse floor entering data about stock levels. Both sets of employees will be working with hand-held devices. High level considerations for your project are:

* The information is sensitive and security is a primary concern.
* The application needs to support a number of functions while disconnected.
* Employees in the distribution centers can only use the app when on the local intranet.
* The application only needs to be supported on a limited set of devices.
* The application needs runs for extended periods; that is 8 or more hours at time.
